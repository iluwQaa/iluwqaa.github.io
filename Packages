Description: This app displays every WiFi password you have ever entered. Very handy if you forgot a password and need to connect another device, or tell a friend the password for a coffee shop without asking that embarrassing question again. Tap hold on the password to copy it to the clipboard. Requires iOS 3.0 or later.

This tweak let you protect your device's system from AppStore apps.
You can choose to allow or block any apps from accessing system.

An alert will pop up when any app tries to access system files. Note: not all application attempts to access system.

Now you can turn on the log of apps accessing system.

If you would like to report any app that cannot be detected by this tweak, please report it to @typ0s2d10, can't guarantee a fix though. I also welcome bug reports via Settings.
Thanks to Alexianos Noad(@alexianos_n) for translating.

Configure tweak options from Settings app. No icon is added to the home screen.

- In iOS7, you may want to set no prompt action
