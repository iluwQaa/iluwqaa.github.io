			<h3>Why 'Reborn'?</h3>
			<p>This project had been EOL and I have resurrected it.<br>One thing to note is that I do not intend to update for non-iOS. Perhaps an update for iOS make it incompatible with other operating systems.<br><strong>Please don't bother the original developer about issues on this version.</strong></p>
